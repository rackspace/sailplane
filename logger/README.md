# @sailplane/logger - CloudWatch and serverless-offline friendly logger

## What?

Logger adds context and when needed, timestamps and JSON formatting, to log output.

This is part of the [sailplane](https://github.com/rackspace/sailplane) library of
utilities for AWS Serverless in Node.js.

## Why?

Sadly, `console.log` is the #1 debugging tool when writing serverless code. Logger extends it with levels,
timestamps, context/category names, and object formatting. It's just a few small incremental improvements, and
yet together takes logging a leap forward. It'll do until we can have a usable cloud debugger.

There are far more complicated logging packages available for Javascript;
but sailplane is all about simplicity, and this logger gives you all that
you really need without the bulk.

## How?

See the [docs](https://github.com/rackspace/sailplane/blob/master/README.md) for usage and examples.
