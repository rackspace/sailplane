# @sailplane/elasticsearch-client - HTTPS client with AWS Signature v4

## What?

An extremely light-weight client for communicating with AWS Elasticsearch.

This is part of the [sailplane](https://github.com/onicagroup/sailplane) library of
utilities for AWS Serverless in Node.js.

## Why?


Other solutions for communicating with Elasticsearch are either incompatible with AWS,
very heavy weight, or both. This client gets the job done and is as simple as it gets!

- Simple Promise or async syntax
- Authenticates to AWS via AWS Signature v4
- Light-weight

Use it with Elasticsearch's [Document API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs.html).

## How?
See the [doc site](https://docs.onica.com/projects/sailplane) for usage and examples.
